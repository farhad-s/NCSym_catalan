\title{Catalan Hopf sub-algebras of $\mathsf{NCSym}$}
\author{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Project description}

\noindent
To identify all the Hopf sub-algebras of $\mathsf{NCSym}$ that are of dimension Catalan and classify them.


\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction - notation and background
\cite{AT20, BBT14, BHRZ05, B08, BZ09, F12, LM11, NT05, RS06}
\cite{S09}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set partitions, non-crossing and non-nesting
\item $\mathsf{NCSym}$ as a Hopf algebra of set partitions which is non-commutative but co-commutative.
\item (Relevant/useful) bases and known formulae for the product and coproduct.
\item subalgebras characterized by primitives
\end{itemize}
\item I think that we have identified all of the possible Hopf subalgebras of $\mathsf{NCSym}$
(or at least the ones that are characterized by their basis of primitives, which I think is all of them).
Let $b_i$ be the number of atomic set partitions of size $i$, for each sequence of integers $(\mathbf{a}) = (a_1, a_2, a_3,\ldots)$ such that
$0 \leq a_i \leq b_i$ there is a Hopf subalgebra $H^{(\mathbf{a})}$.
Let $H^{(\mathbf{a})}_n$ be the graded component of degree $n$,
$$\mathrm{dim}~H^{(\mathbf{a})}_n = \hbox{coefficient of }t^n\hbox{ in }\frac{1}{1 - a_1 t - a_2 t^2 - a_3 t^3 - \cdots}~.$$
\end{itemize}

\section{Notation}

\begin{comment}
A \defn{set partition} $A$ of a finite set $X$ is a set of sets $A = \{ A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k \}$ where $A_i \subseteq X$,
$A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ if $i \neq j$ and $\cup_{i=1}^k A_i = X$.  The sets $A_i$ are known as the \defn{parts}
of the set partition.  We indicate that $A$ is a set partition of
$[n] := \{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ by the notation $A \vdash [n]$ and the \defn{length} of the
set partition $A$ is $k$ and is denoted $\ell(A)$.

A set partition $A$ is called \defn{crossing} if there exists $A_i \neq A_j$ which
are parts of $A$ with $a < b < c < d$ and $a,c \in A_i$ and $b,d \in A_j$.  A set partition is said to be \defn{noncrossing} otherwise.
A set partition $A$ is said to be \defn{nesting} if there exists $A_i \neq A_j$ which
are parts of $A$ with $a < b < c < d$ and $a,d \in A_i$ and $b,c \in A_j$ and is \defn{nonnesting} otherwise.
\mike{The definition of non-nesting is probably not correct}

We will define a few combinatorial operations on set partitions that we will need to describe the algebra structure.
For $A \vdash [n]$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, let $A_{\uparrow k}$ be the set partition
$\{ \{ a + k : a \in A_i \} : 1 \leq i \leq \ell(A) \}$.  If $A \vdash [n]$ is not equal to $B \cup C_{\uparrow k}$
for some set partitions $B \vdash [k]$ and $C \vdash [n-k]$ with $0 < k < n$, then we say that
$A$ is \defn{atomic}.

The algebra of symmetric functions in noncommuting variables was first considered by Wolf \cite{W36}
and much later in a more combinatorial setting by Rosas and Sagan \cite{RS06}.
We will define $\mathsf{NCSym}$ by its Hopf algebra structure as the linear span of set partitions.
We define the finite dimensional vector space
$\mathsf{NCSym}_n = \mathrm{span}_{\mathbb C}\{ \mathbf{h}_A : A \vdash [n] \}$
and set $\mathsf{NCSym} := \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} \mathsf{NCSym}_n$.

The product on $\mathsf{NCSym}$ is defined on the basis elements and extended linearly.
Let $A \vdash [k]$ and $B \vdash [n]$, then
$$\mathbf{h}_A \cdot \mathbf{h}_B = \mathbf{h}_{A \cup B_{\uparrow k}}~.$$

The coproduct on the Hopf algebra $\mathsf{NCSym}$ appears in \cite{B08}
and is equal to
$$\Delta(\mathbf{h}_A) = \sum_{A \subseteq [n]}
\mathbf{h}_{\mathrm{st}(A|_S)} \otimes \mathbf{h}_{\mathrm{st}(A|_{S^c})}~.$$
\mike{notation to be defined above: $A|_S$, $\mathrm{st}(A)$}

\section{Preparatory results about free algebras}

\subsection{Free algebras}
\label{sec:freealgebras}

In this section we define the free algebra on a graded set and state its universal property.  
Let $X$ be a graded set, 
\[
X = \biguplus_{n \ge 1} X_{n}.
\]
The free graded algebra on the set $X$ is 
\[
\mathcal{F}(X) = \bigoplus_{n \ge 0} \bigoplus_{\alpha \vDash n} 
\CC\operatorname{-span}\{g_{x_{i_{1}} }g_{x_{i_{2}}} \cdots g_{x_{i_{\ell}}} \;|\; x_{i_{k}} \in X_{\alpha_{k}}\},
\]
where the degree zero component is $\CC 1_{\mathcal{F}(X)}$.  This algebra $\mathcal{F}(X)$ has the following \emph{universal property}:

\begin{property}
\label{prop:universalfree}
Let $A = \bigoplus_{n \ge 0} A_{i}$ be a graded algebra.  For every function $\phi: X \to A$ such that $\phi(X_{i}) \subseteq A_{i}$, there exists a unique graded algebra homomorphism $\tilde{\phi}: \mathcal{F}(X) \to A$ such that $\tilde{\phi}|_{X} = \phi$, i.e.
\[
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0, 0) (X) {$X$};
        \node at (3, 0) (F) {$A$};
        \node at (0, -1) (A) {$\mathcal{F}(X)$};
        \draw[->] (X) -- node[above] {$\phi$} (F);
        \draw[->] (X) -- node[left] {inclusion} (A);
        \draw[->, dashed] (A) -- node[below right] {$\tilde{\phi}$} (F);
        \end{tikzpicture}.
\]
\end{property}


\begin{proposition}
\label{prop: free algebra hilbert series}
Given a sequence $\vec{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)$ of nonnegative integers, let $X$ be a graded set with $|X_{i}| = a_{i}$, and consider the free algebra $\mathcal{F}(X)$.  Then the Hilbert series for $\mathcal{F}(X)$ is
\[
\mathrm{Hilb}(\mathcal{F}(X); t) =  \frac{1}{1 - a_{1}t - a_{2}t^{2} - a_{3}t^{3} - \cdots}.
\]
%
%
%
%Given a sequence $\vec{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)$ of nonnegative integers, let $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})$ denote the free, graded Lie algebra with $a_{i}$ generators in degree $i$, and zero generators in degree zero.  The universal enveloping algebra
%\[
%\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})\big)
%\]
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item is a free, cocommutative, graded, connected Hopf algebra.
%
%\item has Hilbert series
%
%\[
%f(t)=\frac{1}{1 - a_{1}t - a_{2}t^{2} - a_{3}t^{3} - \cdots}.
%\]
%
%\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%    \item From Jacobson \cite[more specific reference]{jacobson2013lie}\lucas{This is now proved in section~\ref{sec:envelopingalgebras}, we should refer to this or remove this claim entirely.}
%
%    \item 
    Expanding $\mathrm{Hilb}(\mathcal{F}(X); t)$ as a geometric series we have 

    $${\begin{split}
        \frac{1}{1 - a_{1}t - a_{2}t^{2} - a_{3}t^{3} - \cdots} &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty (a_1t+a_2t^2+\cdots)^n
    \end{split}}$$

    Expanding this sum we have the following equality

    $$\frac{1}{1 - a_{1}t - a_{2}t^{2} - a_{3}t^{3} - \cdots}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\sum_ {\alpha \models n} a_{\alpha_1} a_{\alpha_2} ... a_{\alpha_\ell} \right) t^n.$$

    Given $\Vec{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)$, we can consider that $\mathfrak{L}(\Vec{a})$ is generated by the set
    $$X=\biguplus_{i \geq 1}\{x_{(i,j)}: 1 \leq j \leq a_i\}$$
     where for each $j$, $x_{(i,j)}$ is a generators of degree $i$. From ~\cite[Theorem 7 (Witt)]{jacobson2013lie} we have that a basis for the graded components $\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})\big)_n$ is the set of monomials of the form $m=x_{(\alpha_1,j_1)} \cdots x_{(\alpha_\ell,j_\ell)}$ where
     for each $d$, $1 \leq j_d \leq a_{\alpha_{d}}$ with $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_\ell)$ is a composition of $n$.
By counting the number of monomials we conclude that the dimension of each graded component is given by $\sum_ {\alpha \models n} a_{\alpha_1} a_{\alpha_2} ... a_{\alpha_\ell}$ which is the coefficient of $t^n$ in the Hilbert series.
%\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}

\subsection{Universal Enveloping Algebras}
\label{sec:envelopingalgebras}

Let $L$ be a graded Lie algebra with bracket $[\cdot, \cdot]$.  The universal enveloping algebra is the graded associative algebra on the space
\[
\mathcal{U}(L) = \bigoplus_{n \ge 0} \bigoplus_{\alpha \vDash n} L_{\alpha_{1}} \otimes L_{\alpha_{2}} \otimes \cdots \otimes L_{\alpha_{\ell}},
\]
where the degree zero component is $\CC 1_{\mathcal{U}(L)}$.  Multiplication in $\mathcal{U}(L)$ is concatenation of tensors, subject to the relations of the form $a \otimes b - b \otimes a = [a, b]$ for all $a, b \in L$.  This algebra $\mathcal{F}(X)$ has the following \emph{universal property}:

\begin{property}
\label{prop:universalLie}
Let $A = \bigoplus_{n \ge 0} A_{i}$ be a graded algebra.  For every linear map $\psi: L \to A$ such that $\psi(L_{i}) \subseteq A_{i}$ and
\[
\psi([a, b]) = \psi(a)\phi(b) - \psi(b)\psi(a)
\qquad\text{for all $a, b \in L$},
\]
there exists a unique graded algebra homomorphism $\tilde{\psi}: \mathcal{U}(L) \to A$ such that $\tilde{\psi}|_{L} = \psi$, i.e.
\[
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0, 0) (L) {$L$};
        \node at (3, 0) (U) {$A$};
        \node at (0, -1) (A) {$\mathcal{U}(L)$};
        \draw[->] (X) -- node[above] {$\psi$} (U);
        \draw[->] (X) -- node[left] {inclusion} (A);
        \draw[->, dashed] (A) -- node[below right] {$\tilde{\psi}$} (U);
        \end{tikzpicture}.
\]
\end{property}

Given a graded set $X = \biguplus_{i \ge 1} X_{i}$, we also define the free Lie algebra on $X$ to be the graded Lie algebra
\[
\mathfrak{L}_{X} = \bigoplus_{n \ge 1} \bigoplus_{\alpha \vDash n} \CC\operatorname{-spanning}\{\text{brackets of $h_{x_{i_{1}}}, \ldots, h_{x_{i_{\ell}}}$} \;|\; x_{i_{k}} \in X_{\alpha_{k}} \},
\]
subject only to anticommutativity and the Jacobi identities.

%The following is quoted word for word from \cite{jacobson2013lie}. Lie algebras arise from associative algebras in a very simple way. Let $A$ be an associative algebra. If $x,y,\in A$, then we define the \textit{Lie product} or (additive) \textit{commutator} of $x$ and $y$ as
%
%$$[x,y]=xy-yx.$$
%
%One checks immediately that
%
%$$\begin{matrix}
%    [x_1+x_2,y]=[x_1,y]+[x_2,y], \\
%    [x,y_1+y_2]=[x,y_1]+[x,y_2],\\
%    \alpha[x,y]=[\alpha x,y]=[x,\alpha y].
%\end{matrix}$$
%
%Thus the products $[x,y]$ satisfies all the conditions on the product in a Lie algebra. The Lie algebra obtained in this way is called \textit{the Lie algebra} of the associative algebra $\mathfrak{U}$. We shall denote this Lie algebra as $\mathfrak{U}_L$.

\begin{thm}[Theorem $7$ (Witt),\cite{jacobson2013lie}]
Let $X$ be an arbitrary graded set.  Then
\[
\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_{X}) \cong \mathcal{F}(X).
\]
\label{thm: free UEA}
%
%Let
%
%
%Let $X$ be an aribtrary set and let $\mathcal{F}$ denote the free algebra (freely) generated by $X$. Let $\mathfrak{F}^{\mathfrak{L}}$ denote the subalgebra of $\mathfrak{F}_L$ generated by the elements of $X$. Then $\mathfrak{F}^{\mathfrak{L}}$ is a free Lie algebra generated by $X$ and $\mathfrak{F}$ is the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{F}^{\mathfrak{L}}$. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(X = \biguplus_{n \ge 1} X_{n}\) be a graded set and let \(\mathcal{F}(X)\) be the free algebra generated by \(X\). Also, let \( \mathcal{U} (\mathfrak{L}_{X})\) be the Universal Enveloping algebra of the free Lie algebra generated by \(X\). 
    Define the map 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{array}{rcl}
            \phi :  X \longrightarrow & \mathcal{U} (\mathfrak{L}_{X}) \\
             x  \longmapsto  & h_x \\ 
        \end{array}
    \end{align*}
    where \(h_x =  h_{x_{i_{1}} }h_{x_{i_{2}} }\cdots h_{x_{i_{k}} } \in \mathcal{U} (\mathfrak{L}_{X})\) is the product of formal generators in \(X\). 
    By Property~\ref{prop:universalfree} we have the unique graded homomorphism 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{array}{rcl}
            \tilde{\phi}: \mathcal{F}(X) \longrightarrow & \mathcal{U} (\mathfrak{L}_{X}) \\
            g_x \longmapsto & h_x
        \end{array}
    \end{align*}
    where \(g_x = g_{x_{i_{1}} }g_{x_{i_{2}} }\cdots g_{x_{i_{\ell}} } \in \mathcal{F}(X)\) is also the product of formal generators in \(X\). Similarly, 
    define 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{array}{rcl}
            \psi :  \mathfrak{L}_{X} \longrightarrow &\mathcal{F}(X) \\
        x  \longmapsto  & g_x .\\
        \end{array}
    \end{align*}
    From Property~\ref{prop:universalLie} we obatin another unique graded homomorphism 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{array}{rcl}
            \tilde{\psi}: \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_{X}) \longrightarrow & \mathcal{F} (X) \\
            h_x \longmapsto & g_x.
        \end{array}
    \end{align*}
    To see that \(\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_{X}) \cong \mathcal{F}(X)\), notice that
    \begin{align*}
        \tilde{\phi}(\tilde{\psi}(h_{x_{i_{1}} }h_{x_{i_{2}}} \cdots h_{x_{i_{k}}}))  
        &= \tilde{\phi}(\tilde{\psi}(h_{x_{i_{1}} })\tilde{\phi}(\tilde{\psi}(h_{x_{i_{2}} } )\cdots \tilde{\phi}(\tilde{\psi}(h_{x_{i_{k}} })) \\
        &=  \tilde{\phi}(g_{x_{i_{1}} })\tilde{\phi}(g_{x_{i_{2}} })\cdots \tilde{\phi}(g_{x_{i_{\ell}} })\\
        &= h_{x_{i_{1}} }h_{x_{i_{2}} } \cdots h_{x_{i_{k}} }
    \end{align*} 
    Similarly, it can also be shown that \(\tilde{\psi} \circ \tilde{\phi} (g_x) = g_x\) and as such \(\tilde{\phi} \circ \tilde{\psi} = \tilde{\psi} \circ \tilde{\phi} = id\).
    Therefore, since \(\tilde{\phi}\) and \(\tilde{\psi}\) are inverses of each other,  \(\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_{X}) \cong \mathcal{F}(X)\).
\end{proof}

%Let $\Phi$ be a field. For the sake of simplcity we shall now restrict our attention to the case of a finite set set $X=\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_r\}$. Then
%define
%$$\mathfrak{M}:=\Phi x_1 \oplus \Phi x_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus \Phi x_r$$
%
%and $\mathfrak{F}= \Phi 1 \oplus \mathfrak{M} \oplus (\mathfrak{M} \otimes \mathfrak{M}) \oplus \cdots$, and we write $\mathfrak{F}=\Phi\{x_1,\ldots,x_r\}$. The algebra $\mathfrak{F}$ is graded with $\mathfrak{M}_m=\mathfrak{M}\otimes\mathfrak{M}\otimes\cdots \otimes \mathfrak{M}$ ($m$-times) as the space of the homogeneous elements of degree $m$. A basis for this space is the set of monomials of the form $x_{i_1}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_m}$, $i_j=1,2,\cdots,r$; hence $\dim \mathfrak{M}_m=r^m$.

\subsection{Primitives}

The \textit{primitive elements} of a Hopf algebra $H$ are the elements 
\[
\mathcal{P}(H)=\{p\in H:\Delta (p)=1\otimes p + p\otimes 1\}.
\]
Under the commutator bracket, $\mathcal{P}(H)$ forms a Lie algebra. For a Lie algebra $L$, $\mathcal{U}(L)$ is a cocommutative Hopf algebra, with the coproduct $\Delta_L$ induced by the map
\[
\delta :L\to \mathcal{U}(L)\otimes\mathcal{U}(L) \text{  with  }\delta(x)=1\otimes x + x\otimes 1,
\] 
and the antipode induced by $S(x)=-x$ for $x\in L.$
The Cartier-Milnor-Moore theorem~\cite[see Theorem 5.18]{MM65} gives us the characterizations
\[
\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{P}(H))\cong H \text{ and } \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{U}(L))=L,
\]
for a connected cocommutative Hopf algebra $H$ and a Lie algebra $L$.

In the case that $H$ is a connected cocommutative Hopf algebra freely generated by a graded set $X$, we will further demonstrate that $H\cong \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_X).$ To begin, we require the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}~\cite[Lemma 11]{AT22}\eric{We can re-present their proof here, I was looking for different way to show it but havent been able to}.
\label{lemma:primitive generators}
    Let $H$ be a graded connected cocommutative Hopf algebra, freely generated by a graded set $X=\biguplus_{n \geq 1}X_n$. Then there exists a set of primitives $X'=\biguplus_{n \geq 1}X_n'$ that freely generates $H$, with $|X_n|=|X_n'|$.
\end{lemma}
    
\begin{proof}
%    We will show the set $\{e(x):x \in X\}$ freely generates $H$. Fix a total order in each $X_n$, and extend to a total order on $X$ such that $x < x'$ if $x\in X_i, x'\in X_j$ and $i>j$. Then for any $x\in X$, $e(x)=x+p(X)$, where $p(X)$ is a polynomial in generators of smaller degree than $x$. Then the minimal term in $e(x)$ is $x$, and any polynomial $q(e(x_1),...,e(x_n))$ has the same minimal term as $q(x_1,...,x_n)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}~\cite[Prop. 2.4]{F23}
\label{prop:free primitives}
    Let $L$ be a Lie algebra, and suppose $\mathcal{U}(L)$ is freely generated by $X\subseteq L$. Then $L\cong \mathfrak{L}_X$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
%    Let $M$ be a Lie algebra, and $f:X\to M$ a map. We show there exists a unique map $\tilde{f}:L\to M$ extending $f$. As $\mathcal{U}(L)$ is free on $X$, there exists a unique algebra morphism $F:\mathcal{U}(L)\to \mathcal{U}(M)$ extending $f$. We will show $F$ is a Hopf morphism. Indeed for any generator $x\in X$,
%    \[
%    F\otimes F\circ \Delta_L(x)=1\otimes F(x)+F(x)\otimes 1. 
%    \]
%    Because $F|_X=f$ we have $F(x)\in M$, hence $\Delta_M\circ F(x)=1\otimes F(x)+F(x)\otimes 1$. Extending algebraically we see $F$ is a Hopf morphism, and therefore it induces a Lie algebra map on the primitives $\tilde{f}:L\to M$ with $\tilde{f}|_X=f$.
%
%    To show uniqueness, suppose $g:L\to M$ is another Lie morphism such that $g|_X=f.$ The induced algebra map $G:\mathcal{U}(L)\to \mathcal{U}(M)$ has $G|_X=f$, and freeness of $\mathcal{U}(L)$ gives $G=F$, hence $g=\tilde{f}.$
    From Theorem~\ref{thm: free UEA} we have $\mathcal{U}(L) \cong \mathcal{F}(X) \cong \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_X)$ as algebras. Let $f:\mathcal{U}(L) \to \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_X)$ be the isomorphism extending $f(x)=h_x$ for generators $x \in X$. The generators of each algebra are elements of their respective Lie algebras, hence 
    \[
    \Delta_{\mathfrak{L}_X} \circ f(x)=1 \otimes f(x) + f(x) \otimes 1 = f \otimes f \circ \Delta_L(x) 
    \]
    for all $x \in X$. By extension $f:\mathcal{U}(L) \to \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_X)$ is a bialgebra isomorphism, therefore
    \[
    L \cong \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{U}(L)) \cong \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_X)) \cong \mathfrak{L}_X.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $H$ be a graded connected cocommutative Hopf algebra freely generated by $X$. Then $H \cong \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_X)$ and $\mathcal{P}(H)\cong \mathfrak{L}_X.$
\label{cor: free hopf primitives}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    By Lemma~\ref{lemma:primitive generators} we may choose $X'\subseteq \mathcal{P}(H)$ freely generating $H$. By Prop.~\ref{prop:free primitives}, $H\cong \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_{X'})$ hence $\mathcal{P}(H)\cong \mathfrak{L}_{X'}\cong \mathfrak{L}_X.$
\end{proof}

\section{Classification of free cocommutative graded connected Hopf algebras} 

Given a sequence $\vec{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)$ of nonnegative integers, let $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})$ denote the free, graded Lie algebra with $a_{i}$ generators in degree $i$, and zero generators in degree zero.  The universal enveloping algebra
\[
\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})\big)
\]
is a cocommutative, graded, connected Hopf algebra, and we have shown that it is free, with Hilbert series
\[
\frac{1}{1 - a_{1}t - a_{2}t^{2} - a_{3}t^{3} - \cdots}.
\]

\begin{thm}~\cite[Theorem 4.2]{AT22}
Let $H=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} H_n$ and $K=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} K_n$ be two free graded connected cocommutative Hopf algebras. The following are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $H\cong K$ as graded Hopf algebras. 

\item $\dim(H_n)=\dim(K_n) \text{ for all } n\geq 0.$
\end{enumerate}   
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Immediately we have (1)$\Rightarrow$(2). Assume that $\dim(H_n)=\dim(K_n) \text{ for all } n\geq 0,$ or equivalently $\mathcal{H}(H;t)=\mathcal{H}(K;t).$ By freeness, there exist graded sets $X$ and $Y$ generating $H$ and $K$, respectively. Define the series $\mathcal{G}(X;t)=\sum_{n\geq 0}|X_n|t^n$. It follows from Prop. 3.2 that
\[
\mathcal{H}(H;t)=\frac{1}{1-\mathcal{G}(X;t)}\ \text{  and  }\ \mathcal{H}(K;t)=\frac{1}{1-\mathcal{G}(Y;t)}.
\]
Because $H$ and $K$ are connected, the degree zero terms of their Hilbert series $\dim(H_0)=\dim(K_0)=1$ are non-zero, hence the following equality of series
\[
\mathcal{G}(X;t)=1-\frac{1}{\mathcal{H}(H;t)}=1-\frac{1}{\mathcal{H}(K;t)}=\mathcal{G}(Y;t).
\]
We then have $|X_i|=|Y_i|$ for all $i\geq 0.$ Fix bijections $\varphi_i:X_i\to Y_i$ and extend to a bijection $\varphi:X\to Y$. This graded bijection of generating sets induces a graded Lie algebra isomorphism $\hat{\varphi}:\mathfrak{L}(X)\to \mathfrak{L}(Y)$. From Corollary~\ref{cor: free hopf primitives} we have 
\[
\mathcal{P}(H)\cong \mathfrak{L}_X \text{ and } \mathcal{P}(K)\cong \mathfrak{L}_Y.
\]
We conclude by the Cartier-Milnor-Moore theorem that
\[
H\cong \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_X)\cong \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}_Y)\cong K.
\]
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}[Various Sources]
Let $H$ be a free, cocommutative, graded, connected Hopf algebra, and let $\vec{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, )$ count the number of free generators of $H$ in each degree.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a graded isomorphism $H \cong \mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})\big)$ of Hopf algebras.

\item Every graded sub-Hopf algebra of $H$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})\big)$ for some sequence $\vec{b} = (b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots)$.

\item For every sequence $\vec{b} = (b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots)$ with $b_{i} \le a_{i}$, $H$ has a graded sub-Hopf algebra isomorphic to $\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})\big)$.

\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Here is a sketch of what we need to formalize:
\begin{enumerate}
\item %Using Aliniaeifard--Thiem's result~\cite[Theorem 4.2]{AT22}, we only need to compare the Hilbert series of $H$ and $\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})\big)$ to prove this part.  \lucas{Should we write out their proof to convince ourselves it is true.  It is short.}

Following Aliniaeifard--Thiem's result~\cite[Theorem 4.2]{AT22}, one only need to compare the Hilbert series of $H$ and $\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})\big)$.


\item Let $G \subseteq H$ be a sub-Hopf algebra.  By (1), the Lie algebra of primitives $\mathcal{P}(H) \cong \mathcal{L}(\vec{a})$.  Thus $\mathcal{P}(G)$ is isomorphic to a subalgebra of $\mathcal{L}(\vec{a})$.  

By~\cite[Theorem 2.2]{MSZ}, $\mathcal{P}(G)$ is a free Lie algebra, so there exists a sequence $\vec{b} = (b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots)$ for which $\mathcal{P}(G) \cong \mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})$.
%\lucas{Detail: show that this result plays well with the grading?}  
By Milnor--Moore, $G \cong \mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})\big)$.

%Missing: what can we say about $\vec{b}$, i.e. the rank of $\mathcal{P}(G)$?  I really think it should satisfy $b_{i} \le a_{i}$, but free objects are weird so this needs a proof\lucas{Big detail!! This actually seems to be false}.  Since we are wrong here, we still could have a classification of sub-Hopf algebras by sequences $\vec{b}$, but we would need to figure out the correct constraints on $\vec{b}$.

\item Here, we construct $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})$ as a subalgebra of $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})$ by taking $b_{i}$ of the free generators in degree $i$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Previously, we had thought that the condition in (3) above was sufficient, i.e. that every graded sub-Hopf algebra of $\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})\big)$ was isomorphic to $\mathcal{U}\big(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})\big)$ for some sequence $(b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots)$ with $0 \le b_{i} \le a_{i}$ for all $i \ge 1$.  However, this is not true!  

Consider the free, connected, cocommutative Hopf algebra which is freely generated as an algebra by four homogeneous elements of degree one, $x$, $y$, $z$, and $w$, so that
\[
H_{1} = \CC\operatorname{-span}\{x, y, z, w\}
\]
and
\[
H_{k} = \CC\operatorname{-span}\big\{ \text{products $m_{1} m_{2} \cdots m_{k}$} \;|\; m_{i} \in \{x, y, z, w\} \big\}
\qquad\text{for $k \ge 2$}.
\]
By proposition~\ref{},\lucas{I don't want to cause a conflict so I'm not labelling this now} $H$ has the Hilbert series
\[
\frac{1}{1 - 4t - 0 t^{2} - 0 t^{3} - \cdots }.
\]

The Lie algebra of primitives $\mathcal{P}(H)$ is the free Lie algebra $\mathfrak{L}_{\{x, y, z, w\}}$.  Now consider the Lie subalgebra
\[
M = \CC\operatorname{-span}\{[x, y]\} \subseteq \mathfrak{L}_{\{x, y, z, w\}},
\]
as well as its universal enveloping algebra $\mathcal{U}(M) \subseteq H$.
By Theorem~\ref{}, this is a free Lie algebra generated by one element, and by dimension consideration we can take the free generator to be $[x, y]$.  
Therefore by Theorem~\ref{}, the universal enveloping algebra $\mathcal{U}(M)$ is freely generated (as an algebra) by $[x, y]$.
Now $[x, y] = xy - yx$ is a homogeneous element of degree $2$ in $H$, so as the subalgebra generated by $[x, y]$, the universal enveloping algebra $\mathcal{U}(M)$ is a graded sub-Hopf algebra and has Hilbert series
\[
\frac{1}{1 - 0t - t^{2} - 0t^{3} - \cdots}.
\]
Since $H$ has no free generators in degree $2$, this shows that sub-Hopf algebras may have more free generators in a given degree than the Hopf algebra which contains them.

Is is also possible to obtain a sub-Hopf algebra which has more free generators (in total) than the Hopf algebra which contains it.  
Consider the Lie subalgebra
\[
N = \langle [x, y], [x, z], [x, w], [y, z], [y, w], [z, w] \rangle \subseteq \mathfrak{L}_{\{x, y, z, w\}}.
\]
This is free on the set $\{[x, y], [x, z], [x, w], [y, z], [y, w], [z, w]\}$.  \lucas{Definitely true, but details needed.}  Repeating the argument we made for $\mathcal{U}(M)$, we have that $\mathcal{U}(N)$ is a graded sub-Hopf algebra of $H$ with six free generators in degree two, so that its Hilbert series is
\[
\frac{1}{1 - 0t - 6t^{2} - 0 t^{3} - \cdots }.
\]

\begin{question}
Let $\vec{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)$ be a sequence of nonnegative integers.  What characterizes the sequences $\vec{b} = (b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots)$ for which $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}))$ has a graded sub-Hopf algebra isomorphic to $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b}))$?
\end{question}

\begin{proposition}~\cite[Prop 2.2]{F23} 
    If $\mathfrak{L}$ is a free Lie algebra and $V$ is a graded subspace such that $\mathfrak{L} = V \oplus [\mathfrak{L},\mathfrak{L}]$, then $\mathfrak{L}$ is freely generated by a basis of $V$.
\end{proposition}

Define 
\eric{I will write the complete definition later}\[
P_n(\vec{a}) = \sum_{mk=n} \frac{1}{k}\mu (k) \sum_{\lambda \vdash m}W_m(\vec{a})
\]
so that $P_n(\vec{a}) = \dim \mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})_n$.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $\vec{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)$ and $\vec{b} = (b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots)$ be sequences of nonnegative integers. The following are equivalent.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}))$ has a sub-Hopf algebra isomorphic to $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b}))$
        \item $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})$ has a sub-Lie algebra isomorphic to $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})$.
        \item $P_n(\vec{a}) \geq P_n(\vec{b})$ for all $n > 0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The equivalence of (1) and (2) is clear. We will show (2) and (3) are equivalent. Suppose $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})$ has a sub-Lie algebra isomorphic to $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})$. Then
    \[
    P_n(\vec{b}) = \dim \mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})_n \leq \dim \mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})_n = P_n(\vec{a}).
    \]

    Now suppose $P_n(\vec{a}) \geq P_n(\vec{b})$ for all $n > 0$. We will construct a sub-Lie algebra $B \subseteq \mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})$ isomorphic to $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{b})$ by recursively choosing $b_n$-dimensional subspaces complementary to $[B,B]_n$ in each degree $n$. Let $V \subseteq \mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})$ be the subspace spanned by the free generators, so that $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}) = V \oplus [\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}),\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})]$. Note that we can recursively define 
    \[ 
    [B,B]_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [B_n,B_{n-k}].
    \]

    For $n=1$ we have $P_1(\vec{a}) = a_1$ and $P_1(\vec{b}) = b_1$, hence $a_1 \geq b_1$. Let $W_1$ be the span of $b_1$ of the degree 1 generators. Trivially $W_1$ is complementary to $[B,B]_1 = \{0\}.$
    Suppose in each degree $1 \leq k < n$ we have chosen subspaces $W_k$ complementary to $[B,B]_k$. If $b_n \leq a_n$ we may simply choose a $b_n$-dimensional subspace of $V_n$. Otherwise, suppose $b_n > a_n$. Because $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})_n = V_n \oplus [\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}),\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})]_n$, we have
    \[
    \dim [\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}),\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})]_n = \dim \mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}) - \dim V_n = P_n(\vec{a}) - a_n.
    \]
    Because the spaces $B_k = W_k \oplus [B,B]_k$ are defined for $1 \leq k < n$, the space $[B,B]_n$ is defined recursively with $\dim [B,B]_n = P_n(\vec{b}) - b_n$. Furthermore, $[B,B]$ is a subspace of $[\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}),\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})]$, and
    \[
    \dim \frac{[\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}),\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})]_n}{[B,B]_n} = P_n(\vec{a}) - a_n - (P_n(\vec{b}) - b_n) = P_n(\vec{a}) - P_n(\vec{b}) + b_n - a_n \geq b_n - a_n. 
    \]
    Then we may choose $b_n - a_n$ linearly independent elements of $\frac{[\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}),\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a})]_n}{[B,B]_n}$, and together with the $a_n$ generators in degree $n$ they span a $b_n$-dimensional subspace $W_n$ complementary to $[B,B]_n.$ Thus we have recursively defined 
    \[
    B = \bigoplus_{n\geq 1}W_n \oplus [B,B]_n = W \oplus [B,B].
    \]
    with $W = \bigoplus_{n\geq 1} W_n$ and $\dim W_n = b_n$.
    
    Clearly $B$ is closed under the Lie bracket, and is a sub-Lie algebra of $\mathfrak{L}(\vec{a}).$ By the Shirshov-Witt Theorem ~\cite[text]{S09}, $B$ is a free Lie algebra and is therefore generated by a basis for $W$, hence $B \cong \mathfrak{L}(\vec{b}).$
